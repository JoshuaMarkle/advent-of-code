### Thanks for dropping by!

This is my personal collection of [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

Each year, I like to teach myself something new so these solutions are really my exploration into a new language and probably aren't the *most optimal* way to do something.

## 2024 ![Bash Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash%20Script-4EAA25?logo=gnubash&logoColor=fff&style=flat-square)

This year, everything was written in **Bash** cause um, I wanted to. I actually started really late, like on the 16th day so the goal was to get at least 1 star for all 25 days. That is why there are no Part 2 solutions (yet).

**Takeaway:** I'd say that programming in Bash makes you think about how you write code in an entirely different way. All of the variables are really just a string and you have to pipe commands into other ones which can lead to some pretty mind bending oneliners. Because the language is so different, I have only have a general idea how *optimal* a solution is; everything still feels a bit like a black box (probably because I am just calling commands written by other smart people).
