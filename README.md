### Thanks for dropping by!

This is my personal collection of [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

Each year, I like to teach myself something new so these solutions are really my exploration into a new language and probably aren't the *most optimal* way to do something.

## 2024 ![Bash Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash%20Script-4EAA25?logo=gnubash&logoColor=fff&style=flat-square)

This year, everything was written in **Bash** cause um, I wanted to. I actually started really late, like on the 16th day so the goal was to get at least 1 star for all 25 days. That is why there are no Part 2 solutions (yet).
